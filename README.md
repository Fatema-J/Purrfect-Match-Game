## Game Logic

1. The game generates an nxn grid of circles on the screen. 

2. Two random colors are chosen for each level. These colors are then applied to random circles within the grid.

3. Your task is to find the circle that has the different color. Click on it before the timer runs out! The faster you spot the odd one out, the more points you’ll earn.

4. As you progress through levels, the challenge intensifies. The differences between colors become subtler, making it harder to pinpoint the unique circle.

## Additional Features

- [ ] Light Mode
